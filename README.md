NetkeeperForRouter
==================
为重庆地区高校宽带用户编写的一个JAVA程序，旨在方便通过路由器链接到网络。

帮助文档PDF感谢贴吧的好心朋友 @两江大神

这个项目旨在让重庆地区高校宽带用户可以方便的通过无线路由器访问宽带网络。由于Netkeeper通过加密真是用户名来限制高校用户通过路由器访问网络，路由器使用一直很麻烦。

前段时间Netkeeper的加密方式已被破解，并且为安卓用户编写的类Netkeeper拨号程序也已经释出了很久，所以现在也是时候放出路由器的程序了

这个程序可以帮助重庆地区使用Netkeeper的用户方便的通过路由器访问互联网，仅仅只需要输入账户和路由器信息即可。简单，容易，方便。

在使用过程中不会收集任何个人信息或发送他们给任何人。

但是请注意，这个程序并不能帮助那些半夜断网的同学突破断网的限制。也许你能找到不断网的号，然后再使用它。

这个程序是免费的，并且你可以在这个页面获取到源代码。但是，使用本程序，或者获取/修改本程序源代码即表示你同意你不会将这款软件（及其源代码）或者软件的衍生版本（机器源代码）用于任何商业用途。否则，原作者有权利要求你停止商业用途的行为。

Thanks @两江大神 for his help document in PDF mode.

A simple java application programming for who used to dial to Internet with Netkeeper in ChongQing.

This project is aimed to make every students in College in ChongQing could use their Broadband service easily with a Wireless Router. The wireless router is limited to be used in College due to the limitation of Netkeeper by encrypting the account name as real account name to access the internet services.

The encription of Netkeeper was cracked by a student in CQUPT for about 1 year, and the client for dialing on an Android device has been released long time ago. So it's time to release an application for us to use wireless router easily.

The application can help user who is in college in ChongQing and using Netkeeper to access Internet, by simply input their broadband accound info and router info, then click "Set Router Now" to configure the router to dial to Internet just like using Netkeeper. It's easy , simple and convinient.

The application will NOT collect any PERSONAL INFORMATION when running.

For the college with strategy in breaking network services in midnight, this application CAN NOT help you get out of it.YOU MAY NEED TO BUY AN ACCOUNT WITHOUT THIS LIMITATION.
