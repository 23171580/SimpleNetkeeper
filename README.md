This project is aimed to make every students in College in ChongQing could use their Broadband service easily with a Wireless Router. The wireless router is limited to be used in College due to the limitation of Netkeeper by encrypting the account name as real account name to access the internet services.

The encription of Netkeeper was cracked by a student in CQUPT for about 1 year, and the client for dialing on an Android device has been released long time ago. So it's time to release an application for us to use wireless router easily.

The application can help user who is in college in ChongQing and using Netkeeper to access Internet, by simply input their broadband accound info and router info, then click "Set Router Now" to configure the router to dial to Internet just like using Netkeeper. It's easy , simple and convinient.
