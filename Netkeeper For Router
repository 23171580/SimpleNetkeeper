This is a simple java application to dial to internet over router with PPPoE Proctol for who is using the High School Internet Service provided by China Telecom ChongQing.The initial dialing way is through the application privided by ISP called Netkeeper,but it limited user so that the user is unable to share their Internet connection with others or dialing with Wireless Router as they added 8 special characters to encrypt the account name before user's real account,which is called PIN.
The algorithms for calculating these special characters was reversed by a senior in Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications.And so that I can make this simple application available to easy our daily use.
